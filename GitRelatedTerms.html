<ul>
    <li>Term a - version control software - This is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. This is very useful when multiple people are working on the same project. Each person can work on their version of the code and then submit it without interrupting each other</li>
    <li>Term b - add</li>The add command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore.
    <li>Term c - commit</li>This command creates a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it.
    <li>Term d - push</li>This command updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.
    <li>Term e - pull</li>This command Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch. If the current branch is behind the remote, then by default it will fast-forward the current branch to match the remote.
    <li>Term f - clone</li> This command Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s currently active branch.
    <li>Term g - Store the document in your wdv341 folder</li> This is when what I will do when I finish a project, I will add it to my folder so that I can send it to my git repository.
